# About me

From April 2025, I conduct my research at the University of Auckland as visiting Ph.D. student, co-supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Theunis F.P. Henning](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-henning). I have maintained a continuous focus on sustainability in transportation infrastructure, especially the low-carbon trade-offs of highway under life cycle thinking. Currently I do my research at:
